# Guitar Central Landing Page

A simple landing page for a fictional guitar store called **Guitar Central**, built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on using **HTML** and **CSS (Flexbox)** to create a structured and styled webpage.

## Features

- Multi-section layout (hero, featured guitars, testimonial, call-to-action, and footer)
- Clean and modern visual design
- Use of Flexbox for layout and spacing
- Custom fonts and button styles
- Placeholder images representing guitars and gear

## Limitations

- Not fully responsive for smaller screens or mobile devices
- Mostly built with `<div>`s instead of semantic HTML tags (e.g. `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`)
- No interactivity or dynamic functionality

## Lessons Learned

- How to structure a multi-section webpage using Flexbox
- Styling images, text, and layout with CSS
- Importance of semantic HTML and responsive design (to be improved in future projects)

## How to Use

Download or clone the repository, then open `index.html` in your browser.
